# Mitigating Model Drift in Developing Economies Using Synthetic Data and Outliers

This repository contains the code, experiments, and datasets associated with the paper *"Mitigating Model Drift in Developing Economies Using Synthetic Data and Outliers"*. The research focuses on stabilizing machine learning models in finance against distribution shifts and sudden macroeconomic shocks in developing economies by leveraging synthetic outliers.

## Repository Content

- **Notebooks and scripts** for generating synthetic outliers, training models, and evaluating stability.
- **Datasets**:
  - Preprocessed open dataset: [Lending Club](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wordsforthewise/lending-club)
  - Synthetic data with and without outliers generated by [zGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20808).
- **Metrics**:
  - Stabilization Score (SS) – measures relative performance drop under shocks normalized by covariate drift.
  - Stabilization Uplift (SU) – weight-adjusted metric for comparing two models pre and post-shock.

## Key Contributions

1. **Stability metrics for model drift evaluation under shocks**  
   Introduces a two-level evaluation framework (SS and SU) to quantify model performance under sudden distribution shifts.

2. **Synthetic outliers for model drift mitigation**  
   Demonstrates that carefully generated synthetic outliers improve model stability when combined with real and synthetic data.

3. **Focus on economies**  
   Experiments are conducted on datasets from markets where macroeconomic shocks are frequent and unpredictable.
